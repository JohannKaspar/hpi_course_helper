Feature selection aims at reducing a large number of input features to a small set of relevant and non-redundant ones, e.g., by selecting according to data-intrinsic properties (filter methods) by fitting separate models to subsets of the feature space (wrapper methods), or by designing models that perform feature selection intrinsically (embedded methods).\\nHowever, there are scenarios where the features themselves additionally show hierarchical relations amongst each other, i.e., one feature is a more specific instance of a more general feature.

Yet, in real-world scenarios, often a vast majority of the available features are irrelevant or redundant to others, rendering them superfluous for the actual prediction task. While some model classes (e.g., decision trees) intrinsically select the most relevant features, others (e.g., non-penalized regression models or neural networks) have difficulties in identifying these, thus resulting in less desirable model properties such as overfitting, prediction uncertainty, or decreased feature set stability.\\nOne way to successfully remedy this shortcoming is feature selection. Feature selection aims at reducing a large number of input features to a small set of relevant and non-redundant ones, e.g., by selecting according to data-intrinsic properties (filter methods) by fitting separate models to subsets of the feature space (wrapper methods), or by designing models that perform feature selection intrinsically (embedded methods).\\nHowever, there are scenarios where the features themselves additionally show hierarchical relations amongst each other, i.e., one feature is a more specific instance of a more general feature.
